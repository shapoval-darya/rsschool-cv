During searching for my own direction in the IT sphere (browsing various sites, articles, video materials), the most interesting direction was the development of sites, as well as giving them dynamism. To get the basics, I watched video tutorials and read articles on the site https://metanit.com. I am a novice programmer without any experience who is looking for himself in IT.
